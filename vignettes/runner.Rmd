## About
Package contains standard running functions (aka. windowed, rolling, cumulative) with additional options. The most of the functions are already implemented in R (e.g. `base::cumsum`, `RcppRoll::roll_sum`, `zoo::rollsum`) and runner does not improve `base` or `RcppRoll` performance. Instead of speed improvement, `runner` provides extended functionality like handling missings and varying window size. `runner` brings also rolling streak and rollin which, what extends beyond range of functions already implemented in R packages.

## Installation

You can install runner from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("gogonzo/runner")
install.packages("runner")
```

## Examples
The main idea of the package is to provide running operations on R vectors. Running functions are these which are applied to all elements up to actual one. For example implemented already in `base` `cumsum`, `cummin` etc. Functions provided in this package works similar but with extended functionality such as handling `NA` and custom window size. The most functions provided in package are based on the same logic:  

- window size `k` denotes number of elements from i-th backwards, where functions are calculated.  

![window size](images/running_window.png)

- argument `na_rm=T` handling missing and is equivalent to `na.rm`.

![na_rm](images/running_sum_narm.png)

- `na_pad=T` if window size exceeds number of available elements, than first `k-1` elements are filled with `NA`.

- `which` used with running index, which value ('first' or 'last')

### Creating windows
Function creates list of windows. Because `runner` provide limited functionality, one can create running-window-list which can be further processed by user to obtain desired statistic (eg. window sum). `x` is a vector to be 'run on' and `k` is a length of window. In this example window length is varying as specified by `k`. Provide one value to obtain constant window size.

```{r run_window, echo=TRUE}
library(runner); library(magrittr)
set.seed(11)
window_run( x = 1:5, k = c(1,2,3,3,2) )
```

Such windows can be used in further calculations, with any R function. Example below shows how to obtain running `sum` in specified, varying window length (specified by `k`).

```{r run_window2, echo=TRUE}
window_run( x= 1:5, k = c(1,2,3,3,2) ) %>%
  lapply(sum) %>%
  unlist
```

### Unique elements in window
User can use `unique_run` create list of unique elements within specified window size.
```{r unique_run, echo=TRUE}
x2 <- sample( letters[1:3], 6, replace=TRUE)
x2 
unique_run( x=x2, k = 3 )
```

### Running aggregations `(mean|sum|min|max)_run`

Runner provides basic aggregation methods calculated within running windows. Below example showing some functions behavior for different arguments setup. Let's take a look at 8th element of a vector on which `min_run` is calculated. 
First setup uses default values, so algorithm is looking for minimum value in all elements before actual (i=8). By default missing values are removed before calculations by argument `na_rm=TRUE`, and also window is not specified. The default is equivalent of `base::cummin` with additional option to ignore `NA` values. In second example within window k=5, the lowest value is -3. In the last example minimum is not available due to existence of `NA`. Graphical example is reproduced below in the code.

![running minimum](images/running_minimum.png)

```{r min_run_example, echo=TRUE}
x <- c(1,-5,1,-3,NA,NA,NA,1,-1,NA,-2,3)
k <- c(4,5,2,5,4,4,2,2,4,4,3,1)

a0 <- cummin(x)
a1 <- min_run(x, na_rm = TRUE)
a2 <- min_run(x, k=5, na_rm = TRUE)
a3 <- min_run(x, na_rm = FALSE)
a4 <- min_run(x, k=k, na_rm = TRUE, na_pad = TRUE)

data.frame(x, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4)
```


### fill_run
Function used to replace `NA` with previous non-NA element. To understand how `fill_run` works, take a look on illustration. Row 'x' represents, and another rows represent replaced `NA` by fill_run with different options setup (run_for_first=TRUE and only_within=TRUE respectively). By default, `fill_run` replaces all `NA` if they were preceded by any value. If `NA` appeared in the beginning of the vector then it would not be replaced. But if user specify `run_for_first=TRUE` initial empty values values will be replaced by next non-empty value. Option `only_within=TRUE` means that `NA` values would be replaced if they were surrounded by pair of identical values. No windows provided in this functionality.

![fill run](images/fill_run.png)

```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, "b","b","a",NA,NA,"a","b",NA,"a","b")
data.frame(x, 
           f1 = fill_run(x), 
           f2 = fill_run(x,run_for_first = T), 
           f3 = fill_run(x, only_within = T))
```

### Running streak

To count consecutive elements in specified window one can use `streak_run`. Following figure illustrates how streak is calculated with three different options setup for 9th element of the input vector `x`. First shows default configuration, with full window and `na_rm=T`. Second example count within k=4 window with count reset on `NA`. Last example counting streak with continuation after `NA`. Visualization also supported with corresponding R code.

![fill run](images/running_streaks.png)

```{r}
x <- c("A","B","A","A","B","B","B",NA,"B","A","B")
data.frame(
  x, 
  s0 = streak_run(x),
  s1 = streak_run(x, na_rm=F, k=3),
  s2 = streak_run(x, k=4) )
```

### Running which
To obtain index number of element satisfying some condition in window, one can use running which. Functions from this group returns index while condition is `TRUE` appeared before n-th element of a vector. In below example `whicht_run` function returns index of element containing `TRUE` value. If `na_rm=T` is specified, missing is treated as `FALSE`, and is ignored while searching for `TRUE`. While user set `na_rm=F` like in second example, function returns `NA`, because in following window `TRUE` appears after missing and it's impossible to be certain which is first (missing is an element of unknown value - could be TRUE or FALSE). 

![whicht run](images/running_which_more.png)

```{r}
x <- c(T,T,T,F,NA,T,F,NA,T,F,T,F)
data.frame(
  x, 
  s0 = whicht_run(x, which="first"),
  s1 = whicht_run(x, na_rm=F, k=5, which="first"),
  s2 = whicht_run(x, k=5,"first"))

```
